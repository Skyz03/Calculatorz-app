# Current Situation of the app. 

This app was made with React, and has been broken down into different components like Calc, Display and additional necessary Footer or Header components.

Right now the add is funtioning or calculating correctly when button are pressed using mouse but keyboard ones are still need to be in progress. 

The things that need to implement as per tediko app is Theme changer, when + or operationgs are pressed it goes in the top one, and the modal to display custom theme colors and store them in local storage. 

Still a lot of work can be done but found out from research that many other things can be done with ease rather than this complex problem like focus on the basic landing and theme building ideas by picking them from pintreast.
